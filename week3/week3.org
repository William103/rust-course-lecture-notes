* Basic syntax
** basic
** =match= is an expression like =if-else=
*** must have a branch for all variants
*** wildcard patters
** tuple and struct variants
*** try to get =width= on =Rectangle=
*** must pattern match
** same type (function taking a =Shape= can take either)
*** can have an =impl= block
** no heap allocations under the hood

* Problem 1: Nullability
** null
** make our own =Option<T>=
** =divide=

* Problem 2: Error Handling
** tour of how other languages do it
** =Result<T, E>=
** =read_to_string=
** =?=
** Errors as enums
