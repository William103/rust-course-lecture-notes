* Lecture 4
* Intro
* Generics
** =Either=
*** =String= =i32=
*** generic
*** =impl= a bit different
* Traits
** Motivating example
*** =Book= and =Tweet= both with =summarize= methods
*** =describe_book= and =describe_tweet= functions just use =summarize= method
*** this is silly
** =Summary= trait
*** =describe= should be able to take something that can be summarized
*** trait bounds
**** impl =Clone= for =Either=
** Blanket impls
*** =Print= trait
*** impl =Print= for any =Display=
*** =3.print()=
* Motivation for traits
** =Display= and =Debug=
*** =#[derive(Debug)]=
** =Copy=
** operator overloading
